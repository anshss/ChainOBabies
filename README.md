### About Project
What if you can get your newborn registered on it and live this moment forever with the power of smart contracts and that too without any prior knowledge of smart contracts or web3.

That unique feeling that a parent feels can't be described in words...
But This day can be recorded permanently on the blockchain.

And that's what Chain O' Brain allows you to do.

- It provides a simple interface with some basic details to get your delicate newborn lifeform registered on a blockchain.
- By registering, you'll also get warm greetings through messages with our Twilio integrated service.
- And our alan AI bot will guide you through the website.
- This elegant and eye-soothing interface is in resonance with the feeling of the day.

### Future Scope
Staking could be enabled on the platform allowing parents to stake tokens for their children. Newborn's wallet address will be made and staked token will be transferred there directly. Once the newborn turns 18 parent's could gift them there accounts private key. Parents colud also create yearly SIP for increasing staked amount.
